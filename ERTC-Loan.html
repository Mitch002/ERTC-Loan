<p>Here are some common questions and answers about the ERTC Loan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Q: Can I claim the ERTC Loan if I received a PPP loan?</li>
<li>A: Yes, you can claim the ERTC Loan if you received a PPP loan, as long as you do not use the same wages to claim both the PPP loan forgiveness and the ERTC Loan.

</ul>
<h3 id="ertc-loan-calculation-examples">ERTC Loan Calculation Examples</h3>
<p>Here are some examples showing how the ERTC Loan amount is calculated for different scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Example 1: A restaurant with 10 employees had gross receipts of $200,000 in the first quarter of 2019, $150,000 in the first quarter of 2020, and $100,000 in the first quarter of 2021. The restaurant paid $50,000 in qualified wages and health benefits to its employees in the first quarter of 2021. The restaurant is eligible for the ERTC Loan because its gross receipts in the first quarter of 2021 were less than 80% of its gross receipts in the first quarter of 2019. The ERTC Loan amount for the first quarter of 2021 is $35,000, which is 70% of $50,000.</li>
<li>Example 2: A manufacturing company with 50 employees had gross receipts of $500,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019, $400,000 in the fourth quarter of 2020, and $300,000 in the fourth quarter of 2021. The company paid $200,000 in qualified wages and health benefits to its employees in the fourth quarter of 2021. The company is eligible for the ERTC Loan because its gross receipts in the fourth quarter of 2021 were less than 80% of its gross receipts in the fourth quarter of 2019. The ERTC Loan amount for the fourth quarter of 2021 is $350,000, which is 70% of $200,000. However, since the company has more than 500 employees, the ERTC Loan is only available for the wages and health benefits paid to the employees who did not work during the quarter.</li>
<li>Example 3: A retail store with 5 employees had gross receipts of $100,000 in the second quarter of 2019, $80,000 in the second quarter of 2020, and $90,000 in the second quarter of 2021. The store paid $25,000 in qualified wages and health benefits to its employees in the second quarter of 2021. The store is not eligible for the ERTC Loan because its gross receipts in the second quarter of 2021 were more than 80% of its gross receipts in the second quarter of 2019. The ERTC Loan amount for the second quarter of 2021 is $0.
</ul>
<h3 id="legal-and-compliance-information">Legal and Compliance Information</h3>
